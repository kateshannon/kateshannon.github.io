			<h2>Am I making this all up?</h2>

			<h3>Sunday, January 19, 2014</h3>

			<p>I am beond happy to have a website up, in all its simple glory, though I want to do SO much it is frustraing to realize you really have to start from scratch. I should say, start from scratch and avoid adding crazy code that I think *might* work all over the place.</p>

			<p>Reading about organization, coding styles, OOP, specificity and inheritance&hellip; I get glimpses of the big idea, but I would just love to understand it all 100% right this second. Right now keeping my code clean and organized is the most appealing. I worry I am throwing things a bit here and there. But I guess you can't really develop s system until you get your hands dirty.</p>

			<p>In other news, I was happy to try out some photoshop on my little contact icons this weekend. Now to figure out how to get them where I want them on the page&hellip;</p>

			<h2>Maker Square</h2>

			<h3>Monday, January 13, 2014</h3>

			<p>Well, here I am! Week one one, tired, but super happy to be here.
			Tired mainly because my normal evening would involve being in yoga pants by 7pm, not drinking coffee in front of my computer. (sidenote from Kate from future: don't drink coffee next time.)</p>

			<p>I had a few moments of major stress leading up to class when I was convinced that I wouldn't get the pre-work done. Those were some darker moments working on JavaScript loops and feeling my brain ache a bit. Thankfully, I pulled through and actually understood the class tonight, which felt pretty amazing.</p>

			<p>I decided to take the part-time front-end developer class after playing around with some HTML/CSS tutotials and really enjoying them. I hadn't done much, but something clicked and I felt this was a good path to go down. Add baby #2 on the way, and it began to feel like it was really now or never. Tough to work full-time and take a class with a toddler, borderline impossible with a toddler and newborn. </p>

			<p>So to sum up: feeling good. Understand most of what is happening and glad to have gotten through the pre-work. Ready to put together the pieces and unscramble the bits of information floating in my brain.</p>
