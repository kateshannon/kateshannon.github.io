Well, obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example. I made a huge tiny mistake. Yo quiero leche. Yo quiero leche de madre. Second-of-ly, I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh I'm sorry, I forgot, your wife is dead. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary, and we don't need anymore lawsuits. I cheated and I lied and I whored around. Each year, Oscar attempts the four hundred mile walk from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California. In the twelve years that he's attempted this, he's never made it farther than UC Irvine. A million ****ing diamonds!
