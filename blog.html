	<h2>Day One</h2>
		<p>Well, here I am! Day one, tired, but super happy to be here.
		Tired because my normal evening would involve being in yoga pants by 7pm, not drinking coffee in front of my computer. </p>

		<p>you need to do more with Rita. Believe me, I'd like to. You are a worse psychiatrist than you are a son-in-law and you will never get work as an actor because you have no talent.</p>

		<p>And don't make the water too hot. The scabs come right off. He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. Early.</p>

		<p>This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? I'll never forget your wedding. Pound is tic-tac-toe right?</p>

		<p>Happy Franklin Friday. I'm a complete failure. I can't even fake the death of a stripper. I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. It's a gaming ship. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. Stack the chafing dishes outside by the mailbox. I'm on the job. So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me!</p>
