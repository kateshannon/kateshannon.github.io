Well, here I am! Week one one, tired, but super happy to be here. Tired mainly because my normal evening would involve being in yoga pants by 7pm, not drinking coffee in front of my computer. (sidenote from Kate from future: don't drink coffee next time.)

I had a few moments of major stress leading up to class when I was convinced that I wouldn't get the pre-work done. Those were some darker moments working on JavaScript loops and feeling my brain ache a bit. Thankfully, I pulled through and actually understood the class tonight, which felt pretty amazing.

I decided to take the part-time front-end developer class after playing around with some HTML/CSS tutotials and really enjoying them. I hadn't done much, but something clicked and I felt this was a good path to go down. Add baby #2 on the way, and it began to feel like it was really now or never. Tough to work full-time and take a class with a toddler, borderline impossible with a toddler and newborn. 

So to sum up: feeling good. Understand most of what is happening and glad to have gotten through the pre-work. Ready to put together the pieces and unscramble the bits of information floating in my brain.
